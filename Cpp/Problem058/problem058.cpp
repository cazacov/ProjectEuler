/*
 * Project Euler
 * Problem 58: Spiral primes
 * https://projecteuler.net/problem=58
 *
 * Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
 *
 * It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting
 * is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
 *
 * If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed.
 * If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along
 * both diagonals first falls below 10%?
